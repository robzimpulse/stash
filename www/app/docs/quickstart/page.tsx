      <CodeBlock>{`uv tool install stashai

      <P>
        <Code>stash signin</Code> opens your browser to create or sign in to your account
        and hands the CLI a key. A short wizard then asks three things: where to record
        (everywhere on this machine, or only the folders you pick), which of your coding
        agents to hook up — it detects Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI,
        Openclaw, and Hermes — and whether to import your existing session history.
        Recording stays on until you run <Code>stash stop</Code>. Re-run the wizard
        anytime with <Code>stash setup</Code>.
      </P>
      <Callout>
        On an unattended, browser-less machine (a CI runner, a headless box), use{" "}
        <Code>stash signin --api-key</Code> with a pre-minted key instead of the browser flow.

        <strong>Agent names</strong> are just strings on session events that identify which agent produced them.
