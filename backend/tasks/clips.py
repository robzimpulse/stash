"""URL-import worker: fetch URL-only clips out-of-band.

Work arrives in batches of ids rather than one task per URL, and the
dispatcher only keeps WINDOW_URLS in flight at once — a 40k bookmark
import trickles through one heavy-queue slot instead of monopolizing the
pool that renders, extractions, and source syncs share. Batches are interleaved
across domains and fetches are capped per domain, because bookmark files
cluster heavily (a quarter of a real export is youtube.com) and hammering
one site from a datacenter IP is how imports get rate-limited.

Failure routing, in order of preference:
  - 429                → park the row (retry_at); a site that 429s every
                          spaced-out retry escalates to needs_client
  - 401/403 from the   → needs_client: the browser extension refetches with
    bookmark's own host   the user's session (import_fetch.ts)
  - no usable content  → link-only bookmark, immediately (retry can't help)
  - anything else      → retry up to MAX_ATTEMPTS, then link-only bookmark

Every row therefore ends as either a hydrated clip or a link-only bookmark
— an imported bookmark is never silently lost, and the row's error says
why content is missing.
