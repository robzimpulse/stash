"""A connected source can back skills directly.

Skills have until now been folders in the files tree, so a Google Doc could
only become one by being copied in. That copy is a second writer on content
whose truth lives upstream, and the copy has to be guarded against edits that
would silently diverge from Drive.

A source-backed skill removes the copy: `user_sources.binds_skills` marks a
picked Drive folder as a source of Skills, and every document anywhere inside
it that declares itself a Skill — the same frontmatter block, checked by the
same validator, as any other SKILL.md — is read as one straight out of
`drive_documents`. Everything else remains ordinary source material.
Sources are read-only in Stash, so divergence from Drive is unrepresentable
rather than merely guarded.

Membership stays explicit, the way 0181 made it: the flag is on the binding,
not on the presence of a file. A document disappearing upstream drops it from
the source listing and leaves the binding untouched — it can never silently
demote the shelf.
