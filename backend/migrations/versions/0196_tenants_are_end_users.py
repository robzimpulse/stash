"""Rename tenants to end users.

The console and the developer API call them "users" — one end user of the
developer's product. Inside the database "users" is taken by Stash accounts,
so the table is end_users and the foreign keys end_user_id; the wire speaks
user_id, the schema end_user_id, and nothing anywhere says tenant.

Mostly a pure rename (Postgres carries indexes and foreign keys across it).
The one data change: each workspace's "Tenant Notepads" folder — a
user-visible name — becomes "User Notepads".
