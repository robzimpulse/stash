"""Connected sources can belong to an org.

External Multiplayer says an org is "its own pile of files and sessions", and
that "files can be added from a number of integrations, including Google
Drive". Sessions and uploaded files already carry `org_id`; connected sources
did not, so a developer could not attach a customer's Drive folder to that
customer — their org's VFS view listed no sources at all.

A NULL `org_id` is the developer's own source, shared across the workspace as
before. A set `org_id` scopes the source to one customer: only that org's
reads see it.
