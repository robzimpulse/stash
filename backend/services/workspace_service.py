"""Workspaces: a team-owned scope with derived membership.

A workspace's knowledge base is the scope of a dedicated login-less users row
(`workspaces.scope_user_id`). Membership is a pure function of two inputs:
on-domain users (a *verified* email on `workspaces.domain`) are members by
definition — there is nothing to enroll, backfill, or revoke — and
`workspace_members` holds only explicit admin adds for off-domain people
(contractors). `users.email_verified` is the trust anchor for the domain rule:
an unverified `fake@customer.com` signup must never see the customer's KB.
The single SQL predicate is `permission_service.workspace_member_condition`.

A NULL-domain workspace has no derived membership — only explicit
`workspace_members` rows. That is what makes one-man developer workspaces
possible on shared email domains (two gmail.com developers can't both own a
domain workspace, and neither should inherit the other's members). The
membership predicate fails closed on NULL, so a domainless workspace is
invisible to everyone but its explicit members.
