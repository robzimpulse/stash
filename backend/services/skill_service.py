"""Skill service — a skill is a folder whose ``is_skill`` flag is set.

Membership is stored, never derived: it changes only through deliberate
verbs (create a skill, convert a folder, import a repo), so editing files
inside a folder can never reclassify it. SKILL.md still holds the skill's
instructions and frontmatter metadata — a skill missing it is a draft that
says so, not a folder that quietly stopped being a skill.

Files and Skills are MECE: skill subtrees are filtered out of every Files
surface (see ``skill_subtree_folder_ids``) and surfaced in the Skills area
instead. Publishing/sharing attaches a 1:1 ``skills`` row to the folder
(shared_skill_service).
