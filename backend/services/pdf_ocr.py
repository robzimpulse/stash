"""PDF transcription via Gemini vision, grounded by the embedded text layer.

pypdf reads a PDF's embedded text layer: exact characters, unreliable
layout — a three-column parts table comes out as one undifferentiated
stream. Vision reads the page images: reliable layout, but a
transcribed character can be wrong, and a misread digit in a part
number ships the wrong part. So each request carries both. The model
is instructed to take structure from the images and characters from
the text layer; a scanned PDF simply has no layer to attach and the
same call degrades to pure OCR.

The model is `GEMINI_EXTRACTION_MODEL` (Gemini 3 Flash), picked by the
Jul 2026 extraction benchmark on real truck-parts catalogs: it tied the
frontier Claude models at 37/47 gold table rows with perfect digit
fidelity, at fast-tier cost. Output is markdown — tables as markdown
tables, figures described in place — so table structure and diagram
content survive into the knowledge base.

Pages go up in chunks of PAGES_PER_REQUEST, at most OCR_CONCURRENCY
chunks in flight at once, with vision capped at MAX_VISION_PAGES so one
giant catalog can't burn unbounded API spend. Pages past the cap
contribute their raw text layer under an explicit marker — the cap
bounds spend, it must not discard text that pypdf reads for free.

Chunk slices are built lazily, one per in-flight request: the whole
document held simultaneously as slices plus their base64 copies is what
used to breach the extraction child's RLIMIT_AS on scanned catalogs.

Reader annotations (sticky notes, highlight popups, text boxes) carry
expert commentary but mostly render as bare icons, so vision alone
loses them. Each request therefore also carries the annotation layer,
read via pypdf, with instructions to transcribe every note in place.

Unlike `file_extraction.extract_text`, this module raises on failure
(missing API key, API errors) so the extraction pipeline's retry
machinery records the error and retries instead of silently storing
an empty knowledge-base entry.
