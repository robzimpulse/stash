"""Google Drive → drive_index indexer (index only; body fetched lazily).

A Drive source's `external_ref` is a folder id ("root" for My Drive). We walk
the folder tree and store an INDEX ROW per file — its Drive-relative path, name,
and the Drive file id (`external_ref`). We never store the body; `read_source`
calls `fetch_drive_content` at read time, exporting the Google Doc to markdown
with the owner's token. The agent still navigates it like a file system.

Listing a folder + federated `fullText` search use the `drive.readonly` scope,
so the crawl and search see the user's whole Drive (not just app-picked files).

A whole-Drive source ("root") also crawls everything else the user can see but
does not own: the "Shared with me" corpus (files/folders others shared directly)
and every Shared Drive they belong to. Drive parents these outside My Drive, so
without a dedicated pass they would be invisible even though the user sees them
in the Drive UI. Every list/read call sets the all-drives flags; otherwise the
API silently drops Shared Drive items.
