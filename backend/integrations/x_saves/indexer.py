"""Hydrate X (Twitter) saves via twitterapi.io.

Each sync enqueues skeleton rows (tweet ids + a kind): Bookmarks from the X
API with the OAuth token, the user's own Posts/Replies/Articles from
twitterapi.io by account id. A bounded hydration batch then fills them in:
the full tweet text + author (or, for an Article, the full long-form body)
from twitterapi.io, the author's whole thread + the reply's direct parent
for context, and the tweet's images/video archived into object storage — so
the save survives the tweet being deleted or the account going private.
Per-item failures land on the row, loudly; rows are never deleted by sync
(archive semantics).
