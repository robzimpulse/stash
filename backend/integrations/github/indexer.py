"""GitHub repo → github_documents indexer.

The repo is a *connected source*, kept separate from the native file system.
We crawl the zipball (reusing the importer's streaming download + skip rules)
and copy each text file into github_documents keyed by its repo-relative path,
so the agent navigates the repo like a file system via the source tools.

Binary files are skipped — code and docs are text, and we don't want to push
every asset to S3 on each scheduled sync. Idempotent re-sync is handled upstream
by source_service (content-hash dedupe + soft-delete of paths that disappeared).
