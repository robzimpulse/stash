"""Skills that live in a connected source instead of the files tree.

A Drive folder marked `binds_skills` is a shelf. What makes a document on that
shelf a skill is the same thing that makes any other file a skill: it carries a
valid SKILL.md frontmatter block. Nothing is inferred from titles or first
lines — the folder holds reference material and half-written notes too, and a
rule that always succeeds cannot tell those from a skill.

These tests also pin the two properties that made binding beat copying: the
upstream stays the single source of truth, and membership stays explicit the
way 0181 requires.
