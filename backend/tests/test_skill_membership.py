"""Skill membership is stored and explicit, never derived from file contents.

A folder used to be a skill because it contained a live SKILL.md, so ordinary
file edits silently reclassified folders: deleting the file demoted a
customer's skill out of every agent's catalog three times in two weeks, and a
stray SKILL.md could promote Memory into a wipeable "skill". Membership now
changes only through deliberate verbs.
