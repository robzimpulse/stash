#
# This script is the only upgrade path that reaches a stale install. The hook
# scripts themselves live inside the stashai package and run via
# `stash hook run`, which rejects unknown agents before executing anything — so
# an upgrade invoked from inside those scripts cannot run on exactly the
# versions that need it. The plugin auto-updates through Claude Code's
# marketplace, so CLI upgrades have to be driven from the plugin side of that
# boundary. Every other agent's hook config is written by the CLI itself, so
# their config and CLI always ship together and they have no such gap.
#
# This never blocks. The upgrade always runs detached, so a CLI below the floor
# costs this one session and the next session start finds the new CLI. Holding
# up session start while uv works is far more disruptive than losing one
# transcript, and users notice a stall immediately.
#
# Writes only to stderr: stdout belongs to the hook's JSON payload.
