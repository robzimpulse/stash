# Changelog

This file tracks user-visible changes. v0 is the open-source baseline —
everything before it is captured in git history (`git log`), not here.

## Unreleased

- New signups see only the Developer Platform, with internal navigation,
  onboarding, and settings hidden by a per-user flag. Existing accounts retain
  both interfaces.
- Developer curation enforces sharing in backend tools: opted-out inputs stay
  in separate private runs that cannot write to the shared wiki. Developer
  curators use the backend Anthropic model without workspace credentials or
  shell access. Opting out archives the previous shared corpus privately and
  rebuilds from permitted inputs; existing opt-outs are migrated on deployment.
- External curator audit details now stay in run transcripts. Existing shared
  `Log` and `changelog` pages move to a private workspace archive, with public
  and explicit page shares removed.
- CLI onboarding redesigned (#940). `stash signin` walks a first-run wizard
  that can be re-run anytime with the new `stash setup` — no answer is final.
  Session recording is framed as private-by-default and on by default
  (`stash stop` pauses). The agent picker uses `[x]` checkboxes where enter
  toggles and a `Done` row saves. `stash connect` works in any folder — a git
  repo is no longer required. History import runs in the background via the
  new `stash import-history` (parallel uploads; `--status` attaches a live
  progress bar). Re-uploading a transcript for a deleted session now reports
  a clean skip instead of a 404 error, and no longer pollutes plugin upload
  health.
- `stash memory` is now a command group (#941): `stash memory write "<Path>"`
  creates or updates a Memory wiki page (stdin for long bodies) and
  `stash memory ls` prints the wiki tree — the direct write surface for
  agents that maintain the wiki themselves. Bare `stash memory` and
  `--recompute` are unchanged.
- The nightly cloud Memory curator has an off switch (#942):
  `stash memory --curator off|on`, also surfaced in the web curator panel.
  On-demand recomputes keep working while it's off.
- Scheduled agent run history now reports each run's status, error, duration,
  event count, and tool count while preserving the chronological transcript
  feed used by the agent workspace.
- Scheduled agent runs no longer crash in local dev mode: the MCP registry's
  `.mcp.json` is now written to the local simulated workdir instead of the
  literal `/home/sprite/work` path, which is unwritable on dev machines.
- Gong call documents now link back to the original call in Gong.
- `stash vfs stat` once again shows the source-sharing command for connected
  source roots, including roots that do not have an app URL.
- OAuth reconnects now require a stable provider account identity. Slack,
  Asana, Jira, Linear, Notion, and Gong connections refuse to store new
  credentials when identity lookup fails, preventing retained source data
  from silently continuing under a different provider account.
- Frontend server-side backend requests now require `BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL`
  or `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` instead of guessing an environment, so missing
  managed deploy config fails during build rather than crashing public
  Stash pages at runtime.
- Added a committed `docker-compose.local.yml` override for laptop
  self-hosting dry runs. It exposes backend, frontend, and collab on
  localhost ports and disables Caddy.
- Self-hosting now uses a prebuilt `ghcr.io/fergana-labs/stash-frontend`
  image alongside the backend and collab images, so
  `docker-compose.prod.yml` no longer builds application containers on the
  target machine.
- Backend now routes markdown and HTML uploads to the pages table on the
  one upload endpoint, so every surface (frontend drag-drop, CLI `stash
  files upload`, MCP `stash_upload_file`) gets the same behavior. The
  response is a discriminated `{kind, ...}` payload — `kind: "page"` for
  md/html, `kind: "file"` for everything else.
- MCP server gained ten tools to reach parity with the CLI on agent-
  useful surfaces: discover (`stash_search_public_stashes`,
  `stash_read_public_stash`), page search (`stash_search_pages`),
  session ops (`stash_session_transcript`, `stash_delete_session`),
  invite management (`stash_create_invite`, `stash_revoke_invite`),
  stash access control (`stash_set_stash_access`), and table tooling
  (`stash_update_table`, `stash_export_table`).
- Renamed the three unprefixed MCP tools to share the `stash_` prefix
  with the rest of the surface: `stash_list_trash`, `stash_restore`,
  `stash_purge`.
- Added `BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL` env var so docker / self-host deployments
  route the Next.js server-side fetches at the in-network backend
  hostname instead of looping through the public URL. Public Stash pages
  no longer 500 on a fresh self-host boot.
- Added `INTEGRATIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
  `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, and `ANTHROPIC_FAST_MODEL` to `.env.example` —
  every variable `backend/config.py` actually reads is now in the
  reference file.
- Refreshed user-facing docs (`README`, `ARCHITECTURE`, `USE_CASES`,
  `DESIGN`, the `frontend/docs/*` pages) to match shipped product
  surface: real concept names, real CLI commands, real container set
  for self-hosting.
- Bumped the Claude Code plugin to 0.1.84 so the cached
  SessionStart context refreshes — older versions injected
  `stash history *` / `stash notebooks list` references to commands
  that no longer exist.
- Added `stash vfs`, an app-level virtual filesystem shell for browsing
  Stash with bash-shaped commands and editing existing writable pages.
- Kept `stash mount` hidden as experimental spike code; the supported
  production path is `stash vfs`.
